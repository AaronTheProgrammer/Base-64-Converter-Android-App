This Android application allows users to enter a string of characters into a text field. 
The user will then select whether they want to convert the string to base 64 or convert a
base 64 string back to ascii. The user can also choose to replace the symbols (+, /, and =)
with their own custom replacements for those three symbols. This option was implemented because
a user may sometimes want to encode or decode a URL which replaces those symbols. After converting
their string, the user can copy the result that appears at the bottom of the screen.

Be careful: Make sure that you do not accidentally enter a space character when entering your string
(unless you actually want a space character). An unwanted space character in the string (even at the end of
the string) will affect the encoding/decoding.

For those who don't know what base 64 is, here is an excerpt from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64

In computer programming, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data 
(more specifically, a sequence of 8-bit bytes) in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.
Common to all binary-to-text encoding schemes, Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary formats across channels that 
only reliably support text content. Base64 is particularly prevalent on the World Wide Web[1] where one of its uses is the ability 
to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.[2] Base64 is also widely used for sending 
e-mail attachments. This is required because SMTP – in its original form – was designed to transport 7-bit ASCII characters only. This 
encoding causes an overhead of 33–37% (33% by the encoding itself; up to 4% more by the inserted line breaks).
